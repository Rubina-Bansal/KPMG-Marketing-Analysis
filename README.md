This internship gave a wonderful opportunity to experience as to what it is like to be inside the firm. Herein, I worked with the data analytics team in Whitehouse (a real-life scenario was created) and got an exprience around what they do day-to-day in terms of collecing and capturing data, analyzing that data, and drawing out deep insights to be able to present those to the clients.

1. Data Quality Assessment

Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.
